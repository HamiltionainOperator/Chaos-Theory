Dynamics-Based NOR Gate Using the Logistic
Map
Abstract
We demonstrate the realization of a NOR logic gate using nonlinear discrete-
time dynamics. The computation is embedded in the evolution of a chaotic
logistic map combined with thresholding and excess-transfer mechanisms, il-
lustrating how logical operations can emerge from dynamical systems without
conventional Boolean circuitry.
Logistic Map Dynamics
The logistic map is a one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system defined
as
xn+1 = axn(1 − xn), (1)
where xn ∈ (0, 1) and a is a control parameter. In this work, the parameter is
fixed at a = 4, corresponding to fully developed chaos. In this regime, the sys-
tem exhibits strong sensitivity to initial conditions and rich symbolic dynamics,
which are exploited for computation.
Encoding of Logical Inputs
Logical inputs are encoded as distinct initial conditions within the chaotic at-
tractor. Specifically, Logical 0 → x = 0.82,
Logical1 → x = 0.86. These values are chosen such that they lie on opposite
sides of a predefined threshold while remaining within the chaotic region of the
map.
Threshold Dynamics and Excess Transfer
A threshold value xth = 0.84 is introduced. At each iteration, the state of the
system is processed according to
excess = { 0 , xn < xth, xn − xth, xn > xth. (2)
1
If xn > xth, the state is clipped to xth, and the excess is transferred to the subse-
quent dynamical unit. This mechanism introduces nonlinear coupling between
inputs and allows information to propagate through the system.
Iterative Evolution
The coupled system is iterated for a sufficiently large number of steps to elimi-
nate transient behavior. The first unit evolves independently under the logistic
map, while the second unit evolves under the combined influence of its own
dynamics and the excess transferred from the first unit. This iterative process
replaces conventional clocked logic with autonomous dynamical evolution.
Logical Output Detection
The logical output is determined from the excess generated by the second unit.
The output is assigned according to
Output = { 0 , excess < δ, 1, excess > δ, (3)
where δ = 0.14 is a detection threshold. This procedure yields the NOR truth
table, in which the output is high only when both inputs are low.
Discussion
This dynamics-based implementation of a NOR gate demonstrates that logical
computation can emerge from nonlinear chaotic dynamics combined with simple
thresholding rules. Such approaches highlight the potential of dynamical sys-
tems as substrates for unconventional and analog computation, with possible
extensions to more complex logic circuits and hardware realizations
